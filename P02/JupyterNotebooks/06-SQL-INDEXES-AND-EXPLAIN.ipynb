    "### Indexes in SQL\n",
    "An *index* refers to a data structure used to quickly find specific records of interest. For example, imagine we were looking for a specific instructor with a given ID in the \"instructor\" table. One option would be to scan the file containing the instructor tuples, and check if the tuple satisfies the condition. However, for a very large table, that might take a long time. We could also try to do **binary search**, but that would only work if the tuples were sorted by ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "An index is essentially an auxiliary data structure that helps us quickly locate the specific tuple, whether or not the underlying relation is sorted by the attribute. We will cover more details of how indexes are built in class, and the B-Tree Notebook. **Here we will discuss how indexes can be built in PostgreSQL.**\n",
